# Duck Hunt
Duck Hunt was a game released in 1984 for the NES. It featured ducks who had to be 'shot' by the player to gain points. Being very technologically constrained, given the time period and hardware, it was a fairly elementary game, not incorporating much in the way of graphical effects or advanced mechanics. It is for this reason that I chose to replicate it as a novice programming project.

# Info
This version of the game is made in Visual C# and can be built (hopefully) with Visual Studio 2015 Community. It aims to replicate the original game, down to a few minor differences.

Due to the fact that this is - as mentioned before - a novice programming project, the code is not as efficient as it could be. Therefore, it may be the case that the game will run slowly on some machines. Though a timer is set to run every few milliseconds to make ducks move and the game progress, if the game is running slowly then this may experience lag.   
Don't worry, the fact that your machine struggles to run a game with graphics and behaviour from 1984 is not an insult to your hardware capabilities, it is an insult to the efficiency of my code.
